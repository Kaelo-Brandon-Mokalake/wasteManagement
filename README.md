# The app functions as follows
**Section 1: the web screen**
* This is the part that the users interact with, where information is being displayed. By using the
  navigation buttons you can go through different pages that holds different information.
* If you feel the need to update or add any information in our platform, you can hit the **edit** function
  and a window will appear wher you can add,update and delete data.

**Section 2: The data exchanged**
* By using the web screen to add or update information, you exchange data between the the front-end and the
  the backend database.
* Due to security reasons you cannot directly alter data straight in the database, hence why you interact with
  the front-end which is the web screen.
